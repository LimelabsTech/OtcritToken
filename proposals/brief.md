# Actors

* Token owner - `Private key (PK)` holder of address from which Token contract deployed.  
* Investor - Identified person who bought at least minimal allowed amount of tokens.
* Priveleged holders - partners, team members.      

# Token

Before ICO and Pre-ICO we need to create a production ready ERC20 compilant OCR Token.

## Token features

* Token has fixed supply and is not mintable
* Total supply: 65e6 tokens 
* Token id: `OTC`
* 18 decimals
* Token/ETH exchange rate: 4500  
* Token can be in locked/unlocked states:
  * Locked state - tokens cannot be transfered outside from investor.
  * Unlocked state - tokens can be transfered from investor. Unlocked state is only allowed 
    when main ICO successfully completed and all available tokens (65e6) are distributed.       
* Token distribution can be managed from selected ETH addresses controlled by `Token Owner` 
        
## Token distribution table

* 1.3e6   Distributed among partners before
* 3.25e6  Bounty distributed tokens
* 5.85e6  Distributed among team members
* 54.6e6  Public available tokens

## Token distribution among privileged holders

Token contract has separate counters (number of available tokens) for all token distribution classes:

 * Partners
 * Bounty
 * Team
 * Public

Token distribution for `privileged holders`:

* `Privileged holder` provides its ETH address to the `Token owner`
* `Token owner` has the ability to call protected `Token` contract (via `CLI manager tool`)
   method assigning tokens to `PH` ETH address then decrement token counter for 
   the specified distributions class.
* `Token owner` cannot assign more tokens than allowed in token distribution table.            

# Pre-ICO

## Remaining questions:

* What is the minimal amount of tokens `investor` can buy?

## General rules

* Pre-ICO performed by a separate smart contract allowed to distribute 
  tokens for `OTC` token. Pre-ICO contract controlled by `Token Owner`.  
* Pre-ICO contract has a Team Walled address in order to collect investors ETHs if pre-ico finished successfully. 
* Low-cap: 100 ETH
* Hard-cap: 1500 ETH
   
## Pre-ICO phases

* `Inactive` - pre-ico is not started
* `In-progress` - pre-ico is in progress and investors can buy tokens.
* `Suspended` - pre-ico temporarily suspended, cannot accept buy requests. Can be resumed to `in-progress` state.
* `Terminated` - pre-ico terminated, cannot accept buy requests, cannot be resumed. 
  Inverstors are able to returns theirs funds. `Token Owner` can terminate pre-ico at any time.           
* `Not completed` - pre-ico goals not completed. Low-cap not funded and pre-ico finish date in the past.
  Inverstors are able to returns theirs funds.
* `Finished` - When one of the following is true: 
    * Low cap funded and pre-ico finish date in the past
    * Hard cap funded                      

## Pre-ICO dates

* Pre-ICO has its `start date` (can be changed by `Token Owner`). Start date cannot be changed 
  if pre-ico not in `Inactive` or `Suspended` state.
* Pre-ICO `end date` can be changed if pre-icon in `Inactive` or `Suspended` states.     
 
## Pre-ICO distribution rules

* Extra `10%` tokens bonus if investment greater or equal `0.5` ETH
* Investor can return his initial funds only if `pre-ico` in `Terminated` or `Not completed` calling 
  specific pre-ico contract method.
* Invested ETHs can be transfered  to `Team Walled` only if `pre-ico` in `Finished` state.

## Ways to invest:

### Simple 

* `Pre-ICO` contract can accept payments from any ETH address. Investor is `PK` owner of this address.
* `Investor` cannot be identified.

**Pros**

* Significantly faster and cheaper to implement comparing to `Advanced`

**Cons**

* Allows anonymous investors 

### Advanced

* `Pre-ICO` investor must register in private zone at `otcrit.org` using `auth0.com` service
* Web site generates unique investor ID
* Web site allows to create ETH address on behalf to investor, payings to this address 
will transfer to `pre-ico` contract. In the `pre-ico` contract investor identified by its investor ID.

**Pros**

* Investors are not anonymous and forced to accept service `terms of usage`
* Investors can easily control their fundings on website

**Cons**

* More dev resources to implement comparing `Simple` case
* Single point of failure - if website DB will lost all investor identifiers
* Investor do not control their investments from cryptographically point of view. ()This restriction can be resolved.)

# How to control/admin Token and ICO?

I propose to write a simple command line tool helping to manage `Token` and `ICO` smart contract.
This cmd tool will use `PK` of `Token Owner`. It more cheap in development and convenient than a custom 
web based admin panel. 

For example get general token info:

```bash
otcrit token status
 Token name: OTC
 Status: locked 
 Distributed tokens: 650000 (10%) 
``` 

Add a team member to `privileged holders` and give him 10000 team privileged tokens:  

```bash 
otcrit team allow John 0xe486581929055dd2C6eF7B92dD4Cfd83f6Ef26d1 10000   
```

List of all privileged groups:
```bash
otcrit show privileged
 
 team (remaining: 100000):
    Bob 0xe486581929055dd2C6eF7B92dD4Cfd83f6Ef26d1 55000
    John 0xe999581929055dd2C6eF7B92dD4Cfd83f6Ef26a1 10000
 
 partners (remaining 45000):
    Alice 0xe943881929055dd2C6eF7B92dD4Cfd83f6Ef26a1 3000 
         
```

and many other operations

# otcrit.org website integration

Website will show pre-ico/ico status and dates in real time 

# Estimation of Development resources: 

* OTC Token with support of privileged users: 14h 
* Pre-ICO contract: 26h 
* Token/Pre-ICO contract test cases: 30h 
* Command line management tool: 30h
* otcrit.org website integration: 8h
 
Total 108h. 14-18 days to implement.    

* Web private zone for investors: we need to discuss all features
