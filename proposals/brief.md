# Actors

* `Token` - `OTC` Otcrit token ethereum contract.
* `Token owner` - `Private key (PK)` holder of address from which Token contract deployed.
* `Investor` - An identified person who bought at least minimal allowed amount of tokens.
* `Priveleged holders` - partners, team members, bounty participants.
* `Website` - `otcrit.org` website including private investor's web-zone.

# Token

Before ICO and Pre-ICO a production ready ERC20 compliant OCR Token must be deployed.

## Token features

* Token has fixed supply and not mintable
* Total supply: `65e6` tokens
* Token id: `OTC`
* `18` decimals
* Token/ETH exchange rate: `4000`
* Token can be in locked/unlocked states:
* `Locked` state - tokens cannot be transfered outside from investor.
* `Unlocked` state - tokens can be transfered from investor. Unlocked state is only allowed
when main ICO successfully completed and all available tokens (65e6) are distributed.
* Token distribution can be managed from selected ETH addresses controlled by `Token Owner`

## Token distribution table

* `52e6` Sold to public
* `5.5e6` Team members
* `3.25e6` Bounty
* `3.25` Partners and advisors

## Token distribution among privileged holders

Token contract has separate counters (number of available tokens) for all token distribution classes:

* Public
* Team
* Bounty
* Partners

Token distribution for `privileged holders`:

* `Privileged holder` provides its ETH address to the `Token owner`
* `Token owner` has the ability to call protected `Token` contract (via `CLI manager tool`)
method assigning tokens to `PH` ETH address then decrement token counter for
the specified distributions class.
* `Token owner` cannot assign more tokens than allowed in token distribution table.

# Pre-ICO

## General rules

* Pre-ICO managed by a separate smart contract allowed to distribute
tokens for `OTC` token. Pre-ICO contract controlled by `Token Owner`.
* Low-cap: 100 ETH If low-cap is not reached until end of pre-ico all invested eths allowed to withdraw by investors.
Pre-ico state will be `Not completed`
* Hard-cap: 1500 ETH If hard-cap reached pre-ico state will be `Completed`

## Pre-ICO phases

* `Inactive` - pre-ico is not started and pre-ico `start date` in the future.
* `Active` - pre-ico is in progress and investors can buy tokens. Pre-ico start date in the past.
* `Suspended` - pre-ico temporarily suspended, cannot accept buy requests. Can be resumed to `Active` state.
* `Terminated` - pre-ico terminated, cannot accept buy requests, cannot be resumed.
Inverstors are able to returns theirs funds. `Token Owner` can terminate pre-ico at any time.
* `Not completed` - pre-ico goals not completed. Low-cap not funded and pre-ico finish date in the past.
Investors are able to returns theirs funds.
* `Completed` - When one of the following is true:
* Low cap funded and pre-ico `end date` in the past
* Hard cap funded

## Pre-ICO dates

* Pre-ICO `Start date` can be changed by `Token Owner` only if pre-ico in `Inactive` state.
* Pre-ICO `End date` can be changed only in `Inactive` or `Suspended` states.
* Pre-ICO distribution rules can be changed only in `Inactive` or `Suspended` states.

## Pre-ICO distribution rules

* `6.75e6` Tokens distributed in pre-ico phase
* `1 ETH == 4000 OTC`
* `12.5%` Bonus as percent of investment during first week of pre-ico
* `10%` Bonus as percent of investment from second week up to end of pre-ico
* Hard-cap `1500` ETH
* Low-cap `100` ETH
* Investor can return his initial funds only if `pre-ico` in `Terminated` or `Not completed` states

## Pre-ICO investment workflow

1. Investor must read then accept rules and conditions of pre-ico phase.
1. Investor must identify himself by registering on `otcrit.org` website using `auth0.com` service
1. `Website` generates unique ID for investor
1. Upon request `Website` generates eth address (using BIP32 HD wallet) dedicated to `investor` used as endpoint for investment payments from this particular investor.
<br>**NOTE:** `Investor` does not own generated endpoint address. `PK` of this address owned by `token owner`.
<br>**NOTE:** `Website` software signs endpoint address by token owner private key and store signature hash in `DB`.
We have the following tables in website `DB`:
```
INVESTORS:
 investor id,
 investor email,
 endpoint eth address,
 signature hash of endpoint address (signed by token owner),

INVESTMENTS:
 investor id,
 sender eth address,
 amount wei,
 ethereum block number,
 stage: 'pre-ico' | 'ico'
 registered: true|false (true if investment registered in pre-ico contract)
```
1. All funds paid to `endpoint address` controlled by `token owner` (by definition).
1. `Website` software listens eth network (using parity client) for investment transactions and calls pre-ico
contract updating amount of tokens belonging to investor. `Pre-ico` contract received the following data:
   * endpoint address
   * signature of endpoint address (signed by token owner)
1. pre-ico contract updates token distribution for investor using endpoint balance.

# How to control/admin Token and ICO?

I propose to write a simple command line tool helping to manage `Token` and `ICO` smart contract.
This cmd tool will use `PK` of `Token Owner`. It more cheap in development and convenient than a custom
web based admin panel. `CLI tool` must have access to `website DB` in order to access `INVESTORS` and `INVESTMENTS` tables.

For example get general token info:

```bash
otcrit token status
Token name: OTC
Status: locked
Distributed tokens: 650000 (10%)
```

Add a team member to `privileged holders` and give him 10000 team privileged tokens:

```bash
otcrit team allow John 0xe486581929055dd2C6eF7B92dD4Cfd83f6Ef26d1 10000
```

List of all privileged groups:
```bash
otcrit show privileged

team (remaining: 100000):
Bob 0xe486581929055dd2C6eF7B92dD4Cfd83f6Ef26d1 55000
John 0xe999581929055dd2C6eF7B92dD4Cfd83f6Ef26a1 10000

partners (remaining 45000):
Alice 0xe943881929055dd2C6eF7B92dD4Cfd83f6Ef26a1 3000

```

and other operations.
